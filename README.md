# Epidemiology Tracking System

   This project was developed at AngelHacks 2016 in San Francisco, and the premise of this application was to track the trends for the spread of diseases while calculating the risk of infection for an individual within a certain location. Users are able to put down map points to represent locations with cases of infection and input the infectivity of that particular disease using the R0 value (Basic Reproduction Number, where a higher number corresponds to a more infectious disease).
   The application was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript/Angular JS, and the Google Maps API. The Firebase API was also employed as a database for storing the recorded map points for further analysis.
